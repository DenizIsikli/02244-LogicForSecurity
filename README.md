# Security Protocols – Course Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and materials for the *Security Protocols* course.

The goal of these notes is **conceptual understanding and fast recall**, not reproducing slides or formal proofs.
Each week is summarized in a single Markdown file, optimized for revisiting the material without needing the slides.
